Problem Statement: We are given a time-series dataset called DATASET ROAD which is divided into multiple subsections. The whole road is about 25 kilometers long. For about 10 years, an IOT company has been working on this dataset to evaluate the road on 13 different parameters. We have to predict the values of the Parameters 9,10,11,12 and 13 for the 10th year and compare the predicted values and actual values and show the results through visualizations.

Models Employed: LTSM Regressor, XGBoost, Extra Tree Regressor and Random Forest Regressor.

The best RMSE value was shown by Extra Tree Regressor: 42.04
